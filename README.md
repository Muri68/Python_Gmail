This is my Python script that allow you to automatically send an Email in Python via SMTP protocol.. 

For this to work, you should have a Gmail account and Python installed on your machine.
You will also need to install the `smtplib` package:
https://docs.python.org/2/library/smt...
 
For this script to work, you must enable "less secure apps" to access your Gmail account.
As a warning, this is not ideal, and Google does indeed warn against enabling this feature. Be warned!
